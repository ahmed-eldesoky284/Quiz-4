## Requirements

To run this Project in the Wokwi simulator, you will need the following:

- An Arduino board (compatible with Wokwi)
- An LCD 16x2 display
- An analog joystick
- An MPU6050 Gyroscope
- Wokwi Arduino Simulator ([https://wokwi.com/projects/375357526304435201](https://wokwi.com/projects/375357526304435201))


## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-eldesoky284/Quiz3.git
   ```

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
3. Open the Wokwi Arduino Simulator in your web browser ([https://wokwi.com/projects/375357526304435201](https://wokwi.com/projects/375357526304435201)).
4. Click on the "Open file" button in the simulator and select the `Project.ino` file from the repository.
5. Connect your Arduino board with the LCD 20x4 display and the analog joystick to your computer.

6. In the Arduino IDE, go to **File** > **Open** and navigate to the cloned repository folder. Open the `Project.ino` file.

7. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. If not, install them by going to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries** and search for the following libraries:

   - `Adafruit MPU6050` (for MPU6050 sensor)
   - `LiquidCrystal I2C` (for LCD)

8. Select the appropriate Arduino board and port from the **Tools** menu.

9. Compile and upload the code to the Arduino board by clicking on the **Upload** button.

10. Once the code is uploaded successfully, open the serial monitor to view the system output.
